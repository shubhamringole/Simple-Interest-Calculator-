Calculator Use This simple interest calculator calculates an accrued amount that includes principal plus interest.  For interest only, use the simple interest calculator.  Simple Interest Equation (Principal + Interest) A = P(1 + rt)  Where:  A = Total Accrued Amount (principal + interest) P = Principal Amount I = Interest Amount r = Rate of Interest per year in decimal; r = R/100 R = Rate of Interest per year as a percent; R = r * 100 t = Time Period involved in months or years From the base formula, A = P(1 + rt) derived from A = P + I and since I = Prt then A = P + I becomes A = P + Prt which can be rewritten as A = P(1 + rt)  Note that rate r and time t should be in the same time units such as months or years. Time conversions that are based on day count of 365 days/year have 30.4167 days/month and 91.2501 days/quarter. 360 days/year have 30 days/month and 90 days/quarter.
